- 👀 I’m a WhiteHat, Certified Cybersecurity Architect, Certified Systems Engineer, Certified Security Engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently researching cybersecurity concepts as it relates to AI - specifically LLM and Generative AI concepts/theories - and how we can develop protections for both Humaz and the AI as these intelligent systems continue to rapidly evolve, and gathering OSINT and semi-OSINT intelligence against malicious actors
- 💞️ I’m looking to share primarily the IOCs I collect as part of my day job, and some other good security tidbits/tools that may be useful for others
